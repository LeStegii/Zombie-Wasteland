## Description
<details>
<summary>**English description**</summary>
  
This modpack spawns you in a mostly dead world, filled with destroyed cities, only very few vegetation and abandoned structures. You not only have to fight against zombies, bandits and other monsters, but also against hunger, thirst, heat and cold while you try to build a base and survive. The world only consits of a few biomes like wasteland, some swamps, dead forests and deserts. If you are lucky you might find a real forest or a glacier, but be warned: the more survival friendly a biome, the more likely is a suprise attack from behind.
It's recommend to use [**Optifine**](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_G5.jar) in order to have a better performance and dynamic lights.
</details>

**IMPORTANT!**
- This pack is in early developement. Mods and features will be added.
- This pack has two resourcepacks in it. It's recommend to use both, but you have to use the Zombie Pack.
- This pack contains hardcore darkness, which means the nights or caves will be completely dark unless you use a mod like Optifine, which is recommended for dynamic lightning.
- This pack has modified recipies, loot and drops in order to make all blocks available for the player. If you find an item which isn't craftable, I will add a recipe. 

**Magma compatible**</br>
This modpack is compatible with Magma, a Forge/Bukkit hybrid that allows you to use Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins on your Forge server.

In order to install the modpack on a Magma server, remove Thicc Entities and replace it with [this](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/zombiespeedadjuster.95045/) plugin.
